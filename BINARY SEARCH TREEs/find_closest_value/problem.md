Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a target integer value and returns the closest value o that target value contained in the BST. 

You can assume that there will only be one closest value. 

A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left: its value is more than or equal to the values of every node to its right: and both of its children nodes are either BST nodes themselves or None (null) values
