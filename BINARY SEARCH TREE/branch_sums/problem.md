Write a function that takes in a BInary Tree and returns a list of its branch sums ordered from leftmost branch sum to rightmost branch sum. 

A branch sum is the sum of all the balues in a binary tree branch. A Binary Tree branch is a path of nodes in a tree that starts at the root node and ends at any leaf node.

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child noce, and a `right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves or `None` / `null`.
