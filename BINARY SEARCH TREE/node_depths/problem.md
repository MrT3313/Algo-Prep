The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is valled the node's depth. 

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depths. 

Each `Binary Tree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child node. Children nodes can either be `Binary Tree` nodes themselves or `None` / `null`.
