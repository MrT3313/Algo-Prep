You're given three inputs, all of which are instances of an `OrgChart` class that have `directReports` property pointing to their direct reports. The first input is the top manager in an organizational chart (i.e., the only instance that isn't everybody else's direct report), and the other two inputs are reports in the organizational chart.

Write a funciton that returns the lowest common manager to the two reports.
