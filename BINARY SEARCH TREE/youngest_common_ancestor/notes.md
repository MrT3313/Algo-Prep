- need to get to nodes on the same level => then go up one for one on each node => that is the youngest common ancestor


1. First Node => travel UP to top node === X moves
2. Second Node => travel UP to top node === Y moves

3. Calculate how many moves on DEEPER node to move to equal shallower node

4. One to one iterate up on each node and check if the node are the same node
