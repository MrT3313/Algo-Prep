Write a class for a DLL. The class should have a "head" and "tail" properties, both of which should point to either the None (null) value or to a LinkedList node. 

Every node will have a "value" property as well as "next" and "prev" properties, both of which can point to either the None (null) value or another node. 

The class should support 
    1. setting the head and tail of the linked list
    2. inserting nodes before and after other nodes as well as certain positions
    3. removing giving nodes and removing nodes with specific values, 
    4. searching for nodes with values. 
        - return bool 
        
Only the searching method should return a value: specifically a boolean.
