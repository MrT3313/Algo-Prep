Write a functino that takes in a Binary Tree and invert it. In other words, the function should swap every left node in the tree for its corresponding (mirrored) right node. Each Binary Tree node has a value stores in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right" respectively. Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or the None (null) value.
