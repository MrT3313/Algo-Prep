Write a funciton that takes in an array of strings and groups anagrams together. 

Anagrams are strings made up of exactly the same letters, where order doesen't matter. for example, "cinema" and "iceman" are anagrams: similarly, "foo" and "ofo" are anagrams.

You function should return a list of anagram groups in no perticular order.
