Write a function that takes in a "special" array and returns its product sum. A "special" array is a non-empty array that contains either integers or other "special"arrays. The product sum of a "special" array is the sum of its elements, where "special" arrays inside it are summed themselves and them multiplied by their level of depth

For example, the product sum of `[x, y]` is  `x + y`; the product sum of `[x, [y, z]]` is x + 2y + 2z
