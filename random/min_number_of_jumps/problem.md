You're given a non-empty array of positive integers where each integer represents the maximum number of steps you can take forward in the array. For example. if the element at index `1` is `3`, yopu can go from index `1` to index `2`, `3`, or `4`. 

Write a funciton that returns the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the final index.

Note that jumping from index `i` ro index `i + x` always constitutes one jump, no matter how large `x` is.
