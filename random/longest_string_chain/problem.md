Given a list of strings, write a function that returns the longest string chain that can be built from those strings. 
    - A string chain is defined as follows: let string A be a string in the initial array; if removing any single character from string A yields a new string B that is contained in the initial array of strings, then strings A and B form a string chain of length 2. Similarly, if removing any single character from string B yields a new string C that is contained in the initial array of strings, then strings A, B, and C form a string chain of length 3. 
    - The function should return the string chain in descending order (i.e. from the longest string to the shortest one). 
    - Note the string chains of length 1 do not exist; if the list of strings doe not contain any string chain formed by 2 or more strings, the function should return an empty list.
