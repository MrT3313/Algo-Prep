Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List that contains a loop (in other words, the list's tail node points to some node in the list instead of `None` / `null`). The function should return the node (the actual node--not just its value) from which the loop originates in constant space. 

Each `LinkedList` node ahs an integer `value` as well as `next` node pointing to the next node in the list.
