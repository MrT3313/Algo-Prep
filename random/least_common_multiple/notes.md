# Planning

Best Case = max of two numbers
    - EX: LCM(2,4) = 4

    - Larger number is a good STARTING point

Worst Case = multiple of two numbers
    - EX: LCM (11, 17) = 11 * 17

    - product of the two numbers is ALWAYS going to me A multiple but not always the SMALLEST => a good STOPPING point
        - EX: LCM(3,4)
            - Possibilities: 4 (best case), 8, 12 (worst case) => then find what is divisible by smaller number

# Notes

Prime Factorization

18 = 2 * 9 => 2 * 3 * 3
^ num of 2's = 1
^ bynn if 3's = 2

12 = 2 * 6 => 2 * 2 * 3
^ num of 2's = 2
^ bynn if 3's = 1

LCM = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 => 36
