Write a funciton that takes in the head of a Single Linked List and an integer `k` and removes the kth node from the end of the list. 

Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node pointing to the next node in the list or to `None` / ` null` if it's the tail of the list. 

You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least 2 nodes and, more specifically, at least k nodes.
