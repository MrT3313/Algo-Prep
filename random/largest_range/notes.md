1. Notes
- Sort array
    - is increment +1 
    - save valid ranges

- Hash Table
    - put all number in hash table
    - set initial value to falsy --> check if it has been visited yet

    - current number
        - LESS than --> check if x - 1 is there
        - GREATER than --> check if x + 1 is there
        - if number exists change hash table value to true (has been checked)
