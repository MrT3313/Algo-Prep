You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of distinct integers and a target integer. Each row in the matrix is sorted and each column is also sorted; the matrix doesn't necessarily have the same height and width.

Write a function that returns an array of the row and column indecies of the integer of it's contained in the matrix, otherwise `[-1, -1]`
