You are given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children Nodes. When put together, Nodes form a simple tree-like structure. Implement the breadthFirstSearch method on the Node class, which taken in an empty array, traverse the tree using the Breadth-first Search approach (specifically navigating the tree from left to right), stores all the Nodes' names in the input array, and returns it. 

Input:
     A
    /|\
   B C D
  /\   /\
 E  F G  H
   /\  \
  I  J  K

Output:
["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K"]
