Implement a MinHeap class that supports:
- Building a Min Heap from an input array of integers
- Inserting integers into the heap
- Removing the heaps minimum / root value
- Peeking at the heaps minimum / root value
- sifting integers up and down the heap, which is to be used wen inserting an dremoving values

Nota that the heap should be represented in the form of an array.
